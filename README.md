# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Natural Language Processing

In the last two years, advances in artificial intelligence have driven leaps forward in natural language processing. Computers can now convincingly compose stories, answer questions about text, summarize documents, and learn abstract concepts through reading.  **AI is advancing our ability to make decisions from complex data sets.  Together, these advances provide some novel and ambitious possibilities for how humans might interact with machines.** Weâ€™ll explore how this revolution started, and try out some of the next-generation capabilities.
